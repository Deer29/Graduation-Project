    <h2>Horus:</h2>
    <p>He is the sun god of the ancient Egyptians.</p>
    <h2>Horus as the name of the king</h2>
    <p>Horus' work was the highest example for all the kings of Egypt, as he avenged his father who killed him and was just. Therefore, they took the name “Living Horus,” which is one of the oldest royal titles in ancient Egypt. His name was mentioned in ancient times in association with Hathor and the first Scorpion King. In this title, Horus appears standing on the palace edifice, surrounded by the name of the king.
        We also find Horus on the Narmer stela, or the famous painting of King Menes, which is from the era of the First Dynasty in Egypt, holding the heads of Egypt's defeated enemies and presenting them to the king. Until the Fourth Dynasty, the pharaoh's title consisted of the name Horus only, and in that dynasty the name Horus the Golden also appeared, as a second title for the king.</p>
