    <h1>Isis</h1>

    <h2>Isis:</h2>
    <p>Isis is a major goddess in ancient Egyptian religion whose worship spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. Isis was first mentioned in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2686-2181 BC) as one of the main characters in the Osiris myth, as she revived her husband, the slain divine king Osiris, and also gave birth to his heir, Horus, and protected him. Isis was believed to guide the dead to the afterlife and also helped Osiris, and she was considered the divine mother of the pharaoh, who was likened to her son Horus.
        Her maternal assistance was a healing spell to help the common people. Originally Isis played a small role in royal hymns and temple rituals, but she was more important in burial rituals and magical texts. She was often represented in art as a human female wearing what looked like a throne on her head. During the New Kingdom, she took on the features of Hathor - the previously prominent goddess - as Isis came to be represented wearing Hathor's clothing, with a sun disk on her head between the horns of a cow, as Hathor had previously been represented.

    <h2>Goddess of magic and wisdom</h2>
    <p>Isis was also known for her magical powers, which enabled her to revive Osiris and protect and heal Horus, and for her cunning. Thanks to her magical powers, she was said to be "more skilled than a million gods." In several versions of the New Kingdom story "Horus' Rivalry with Set", Isis used these powers to maneuver Set during his conflict with her son. In one case, she is transformed into a young woman who tells Set that she is in a succession struggle similar to Set's usurpation of Osiris' crown. When Set judged the situation to be unjust, Isis mocked him, saying that he had judged himself wrong. In later texts, she used her powers of transformation to fight and destroy Set and his followers.
        Many stories about Isis were prequels or introductions to magical texts that described mythological events associated with the intended object of the spell. In one of the spells, Isis created a snake that would bite Ra - who was larger and more powerful than her - making him sick with its venom. She then offered to heal Ra if he told her his true, secret name, a piece of information that carried with it infinite power. After much coercion, Ra told her his name, which she passed on to Horus in order to support his royal authority. The meaning of the story may be to explain why Isis's magical powers exceed all other gods. But because she used magic to coerce Ra, the story deems her to have these powers even before she knew his secret name.

    <h2>Heaven goddess</h2>
    <p>The many roles that Isis played gave her an important position in heaven. Passages in the Pyramid Texts link Isis with Sobdeet - the goddess represented by the star Sirius -, and about her relationship with her husband Sah (the constellation Orion) and their son Sobdo, which parallels Isis's relationship with Osiris and Horus. The stellar rising of Sobdet - just before the Nile floods - gives an intimate connection to the flood and the subsequent growth of plants.
        Partly because of her relationship with Sodeta, Isis was also associated with the flood, which was considered the tears she shed on Osiris. By the Ptolemaic era, Isis was associated with the rain, which the Egyptians called in their texts “the Nile in the sky,” with the sun, the protector god Ra, and with the moon, most likely because of her connection to the Greek moon goddess Artemis through a common relationship, which is the Egyptian goddess of fertility, Bastet. In one of the hymns inscribed on Philae, he called Isis “Mistress of Heaven,” whose control over the heavens paralleled Osiris’s control over the Duat (underworld) and Horus’ kingship on earth.
