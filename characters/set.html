    <h2>set:</h2>
    <p>Set is the god of the desert , storms , and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion .  In later mythology he was also the god of darkness and chaos .
        In Pharaonic mythology , Set is depicted as a usurper who killed and mutilated his brother Osiris . Isis , wife of Osiris, reassembled his body and mummified it. Horus , son of Osiris, sought revenge on Set, and myths describe their struggles. The death of Osiris and the battle between Horus and Set is a popular event in Egyptian mythology.
        As for the era of the Hyksos occupation of Egypt (they were expelled by the King of Egypt, Ahmose ), they combined Set with their Semitic deity, Baal (Baar in hieroglyphics), and he became the chief of their gods, so they worshiped him and sanctified him under the name Sutekh .
        The god "Ra" sought his help in eliminting "The snake Abu Face" during his solar journey to the other world
